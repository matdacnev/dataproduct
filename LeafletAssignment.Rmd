```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include=T, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, cache=T)
setwd("~/Work/Training/DataProdCoursera.R")
```

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to create a web page with an interactive map. To do this, I wrote an R markdown document and used the Leaflet package.

## Libraries

The following library is used for this assignment:

```{r library}
library(leaflet)
```

## Map

The map shows the location of the University of Geneva and clicking on the pin will reveal the university home page URL. I added a mini map showing the region around the main map.

```{r map}
myPopup = "<a href='http://www.unige.ch/'>University of Geneva</a>"
myMap = leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lat=46.1970432, lng=6.1424338, popup=myPopup) %>% addMiniMap()
myMap
```
